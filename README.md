# Angular Micro-Frontend Reference

A **production-grade reference implementation** of an Angular micro-frontend architecture using [Native Federation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@angular-architects/native-federation). Every remote is a fully independent Angular application that is composed at runtime by a shell — no monorepo build step required.

The repo demonstrates what a real MFE platform looks like end-to-end: dynamic menus driven by a REST API, signal-based shared state, a global command palette, dark mode with PrimeNG tokens, and a deployment story that scales from a single `docker-compose up` to a Kubernetes cluster with Gateway API HTTPRoutes and custom CRDs.

## What this demonstrates

| Feature | Implementation |
|---|---|
| Runtime module loading | Native Federation `loadRemoteModule` |
| Dynamic routes from API | `MenuRegistryService` + `MenuRouterSyncService` with Angular signals |
| Cross-MFE shared state | `AppStateService` singleton via NF `shared: { singleton: true }` |
| Cross-tab state sync | `BroadcastChannel` with loop-safe guard (`Set` + `queueMicrotask`) |
| Zoneless change detection | `provideZonelessChangeDetection()` across all apps |
| Standalone components | All apps use `bootstrapApplication` — no `NgModule` |
| Global command palette | Shell-level `S` shortcut + click-to-open from any remote |
| Dark mode | PrimeNG Aura semantic tokens + `.dark-theme` body class |
| Reactive chart themes | Chart.js dataset colors swap via `effect()` on theme signal |
| Independent deployability | Each app has its own `package.json`, build, and dev server |
| Dev ergonomics | `prestart` hook auto-clears NF cache; proxy rewrites `/api/menu` to mock |

## Key technical decisions

### Native Federation over Webpack Module Federation

Native Federation works at the ESM level — it uses browser-native `import()` instead of Webpack's custom module system. This means:
- No Webpack required in remotes; Angular CLI's default Vite/esbuild pipeline works unchanged.
- Remotes can be served from any static file host (CDN, nginx, S3).
- Shared singletons (Angular core, `@czprz/broker`, PrimeNG) are deduplicated at runtime via importmaps.

The trade-off is a native federation cache in `node_modules/.cache/native-federation/` that is keyed by package version (not content). Any time a shared package is rebuilt, this cache must be cleared — the `prestart` npm hook handles this automatically.

### Zoneless + standalone components

All apps opt out of Zone.js:

```ts
// every app.config.ts
provideZonelessChangeDetection()
```

This means change detection only runs when signals change or events fire explicitly — not on every async operation. Combined with standalone components and `bootstrapApplication` (no `NgModule`), the apps are leaner and easier to reason about.

### Signal-based shared state (broker)

`@czprz/broker` is a shared Angular library that NF loads as a singleton. It exposes:

- **`AppStateService`** — `theme`, `token`, `uri`, `users` as writable signals. Each signal is persisted to `localStorage` and broadcast to other tabs via `BroadcastChannel`. Incoming cross-tab updates are guarded with `Set<keyof AppState>` + `queueMicrotask()` to prevent feedback loops when signals hold reference types (arrays).

- **`MenuRegistryService`** — a signal-based registry of `MenuItem` objects. The shell's `provideAppInitializer` fetches `/api/menu` at startup and calls `menuRegistry.load()`. Any remote can call `register()` or `unregister()` at any time.

Because the library is a NF singleton, the same service instance is shared across shell, menu, toolbar, and all page remotes — no prop-drilling, no event buses.

### Dynamic routes from REST API

The shell never has hard-coded routes. On startup:

1. `MenuRouterSyncService` starts an `effect()` that watches `menuRegistry.items()`.
2. A `provideAppInitializer` fetches `GET /api/menu` and calls `menuRegistry.load(items)`.
3. The effect fires, maps each `MenuItem` to a `loadChildren` route, and calls `router.resetConfig()`.

```ts
// menu-router-sync.service.ts (simplified)
effect(() => {
  const dynamic: Routes = this.menuRegistry.items().map(item => ({
    path: item.path,
    loadChildren: () =>
      loadRemoteModule(item.remote, item.exposedModule)
        .then(m => m[item.routesExport ?? 'APP_ROUTES']),
  }));
  this.router.resetConfig([...dynamic, ...this.staticRoutes]);
});
```

In dev, `proxy.conf.js` rewrites `/api/menu` to the local `mock-menu.json`. In production, the real backend serves the same shape.

### Command palette

A VS Code-style global search lives in the shell as `CommandPaletteComponent`. It:
- Opens with `S` (when focus is not in an input) or by clicking the sidebar search bar.
- Filters all registered `MenuItem` objects from `MenuRegistryService` in real-time.
- Navigates with `↑` / `↓` / `Enter`, closes with `Escape`.
- Works cross-MFE: the sidebar menu calls `appState.openSearch()` which fires a `BroadcastChannel` message the shell listens to.

### Dark mode token architecture

PrimeNG Aura defines component tokens (e.g. `--p-card-background`) on `:root` as `var(--p-content-background)`. Chromium resolves `var()` chains eagerly at the `:root` scope, locking them to the light value even when `body.dark-theme` overrides `--p-content-background`.

The fix: explicitly re-declare affected tokens inside `.dark-theme` in `dark-purple.scss`:

```scss
.dark-theme {
  color-scheme: dark;
  --p-card-background:    var(--p-surface-800);  // #27272a
  --p-popover-background: var(--p-surface-800);
  // ... other affected tokens
}
```

Any custom overlay or panel you add should use `--p-card-background` rather than `--p-content-background` to inherit this fix automatically.

## Getting started

**Prerequisites:** Node.js 20+ (or 24.15.0+), npm 9+

```bash
# 1. Install all workspaces
npm install

# 2. Build the shared broker library
npm run build:libs

# 3. Start all 7 apps (auto-clears NF cache first)
npm run start
```

Open **http://localhost:4200**.

> The `prestart` hook runs `clean:nf` automatically before every `npm run start`, clearing the Native Federation external cache. You never need to run it manually.

Individual apps:

```bash
npm run start:shell     # :4200
npm run start:menu      # :4201
npm run start:toolbar   # :4202
# ... start:overview, start:reports, start:analytics, start:export
```

After changing `@czprz/broker`, rebuild it before restarting:

```bash
npm run build:libs
npm run start   # prestart clears NF cache automatically
```

|---|---|
| Shell (host) | http://localhost:4200 |
| Menu remote | http://localhost:4201 |

## Kubernetes

### Why K8s and micro-frontends are a natural fit

The biggest advantage of micro-frontends is independent deployability — a team ships their feature without coordinating with anyone else. Kubernetes makes this operationally real:

| Capability | How it works |
|---|---|
| **Independent routing** | Each MFE owns its own `HTTPRoute` or `Ingress` rule. Installing a new chart automatically adds its path prefix to the gateway — no shared config to edit. |
| **Independent scaling** | The overview dashboard (heavy data) can run 10 replicas while the export page runs 1. |
| **Independent rollouts** | Rolling update one remote while all others keep serving traffic. |
| **Health isolation** | A crashing analytics pod does not affect the shell or menu. Liveness probes remove bad pods silently. |
| **Zero-downtime config** | Gateways merge and reload route rules without dropping connections. |

### Gateway API — HTTPRoute over Ingress

The Kubernetes [Gateway API](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/) (`HTTPRoute`) is the successor to `Ingress` and is the recommended approach for new deployments. It gives each micro-frontend team **full ownership of their routing rule** without needing cluster-level `Ingress` permissions.

```yaml
# charts/overview/templates/httproute.yaml
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: HTTPRoute
metadata:
  name: overview
  namespace: mfe-apps
spec:
  parentRefs:
    - name: mfe-gateway         # Shared gateway — owned by platform team
      namespace: mfe-infra
  rules:
    - matches:
        - path:
            type: PathPrefix
            value: /remotes/overview
      filters:
        - type: URLRewrite
          urlRewrite:
            path:
              type: ReplacePrefixMatch
              replacePrefixMatch: /
      backendRefs:
        - name: overview-svc
          port: 80
```

The shell builds its Native Federation manifest dynamically from the menu API response — each `MenuItem` carries a `remoteEntry` URL that the operator writes in from the CRD spec:

```json
GET /api/menu
[
  { "remote": "overview", "remoteEntry": "https://my-cluster.example.com/remotes/overview/remoteEntry.json", ... },
  { "remote": "reports",  "remoteEntry": "https://my-cluster.example.com/remotes/reports/remoteEntry.json",  ... }
]
```

```ts
// main.ts — before Angular bootstraps
const items = await fetch('/api/menu').then(r => r.json());
const manifest = {
  ...environment.infrastructureRemotes,            // menu, toolbar — always present
  ...Object.fromEntries(items.map(i => [i.remote, i.remoteEntry])),  // CRD-driven
};
await initFederation(manifest);
```

When a team **deploys** their chart, their `HTTPRoute` is created, the operator registers the `MenuEntry`, and the shell discovers the new remote on the next load. When they **remove** it, the route disappears and the menu item is gone. No other team touches anything.

### Helm chart structure

```

├── base/                   # Platform team — gateway, shell, menu-service
│   └── templates/
│       ├── gateway.yaml            # Shared Gateway resource
│       ├── shell-deployment.yaml
│       ├── shell-httproute.yaml    # Catches / (default)

├── reports/                # Reports team
├── analytics/              # Analytics team
└── export/                 # Export team
```

```bash
# Platform team installs the gateway and shell once
helm install base ./charts/base

# Each feature team deploys independently
helm install overview  ./charts/overview
helm install reports   ./charts/reports

# Remove a feature — route and pods gone, nothing else touched
helm uninstall reports
```

### CRD-based menu registration

Hard-coding the menu in a `ConfigMap` or environment variable requires a shell restart every time a route changes. A better approach: a **`MenuEntry` CRD** that a lightweight operator watches. When a Helm chart installs a `MenuEntry`, the operator syncs it to the menu service. When the chart is removed, the operator de-registers it automatically.

```yaml
# CRD definition (installed once by the platform team)
apiVersion: apiextensions.k8s.io/v1
kind: CustomResourceDefinition
metadata:
  name: menuentries.mfe.example.com
spec:
  group: mfe.example.com
  versions:
    - name: v1alpha1
      served: true
      storage: true
      schema:
        openAPIV3Schema:
          type: object
          properties:
            spec:
              type: object
              required: [label, path, remote, exposedModule]
              properties:
                label:        { type: string }
                path:         { type: string }
                icon:         { type: string }
                group:        { type: string }
                remote:       { type: string }
                exposedModule: { type: string }
                routesExport: { type: string }
                permissions:
                  type: array
                  items: { type: string }
  scope: Namespaced
  names:
    plural: menuentries
    singular: menuentry
    kind: MenuEntry
```

Each feature chart ships one `MenuEntry` resource:

```yaml
# charts/overview/templates/menuentry.yaml
apiVersion: mfe.example.com/v1alpha1
kind: MenuEntry
metadata:
  name: overview
  namespace: mfe-apps
spec:
  label: Dashboard
  path: dashboard
  icon: pi pi-home
  group: Overview
  remote: overview
  exposedModule: ./routes
  permissions:
    - user
    - admin
```

A simple operator (e.g. built with [Kopf](https://kopf.readthedocs.io/) or [controller-runtime](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/controller-runtime)) watches for `MenuEntry` create/update/delete events and calls the menu service's REST API:

```
MenuEntry created  →  POST  /api/menu   { ...spec }
MenuEntry deleted  →  DELETE /api/menu/{name}
```

The shell fetches `/api/menu` on load (or via a WebSocket push), builds dynamic routes from the response, and the new page appears — **without touching the shell, the menu service, or any other team's chart**.

### The full dynamic deployment loop

```
A feature team ships a new micro-frontend
  │
  ├─ 1. helm install reports ./charts/reports
  │        Kubernetes creates:
  │          - Deployment + Service  (the Angular remote)
  │          - HTTPRoute             (path /remotes/reports → reports-svc)
  │          - MenuEntry CR          (label, path, icon, permissions)
  │
  ├─ 2. Operator detects MenuEntry create
  │        POST /api/menu  { label: "Reports", path: "reports", ... }
  │
  ├─ 3. User opens the shell (or shell re-polls /api/menu)
  │        MenuRegistryService.load(items)
  │        MenuRouterSyncService effect() fires → router.resetConfig()
  │        Navigation sidebar and command palette now include "Reports"
  │
  └─ 4. User navigates to /reports
           loadRemoteModule('reports', './routes') fetches from gateway
           Angular boots the remote bundle
           Reports page renders ✓

The team removes their feature
  │
  ├─ 1. helm uninstall reports
  │        HTTPRoute deleted → gateway stops routing /remotes/reports
  │        MenuEntry deleted → operator calls DELETE /api/menu/reports
  │
  └─ 2. Shell re-polls: "reports" gone from response
           Route and nav link disappear automatically ✓
           No shell rebuild. No config edits. No other team involved.
```

This is where micro-frontends and Kubernetes compound each other's value. The independence you get architecturally (each team owns their code) becomes independence you get operationally (each team owns their deployment) — and the CRD bridges the two by making routing and menu registration declarative Kubernetes resources.

## Purpose

This repo exists to show a practical, runnable example of:

- **Native Federation** with Angular — loading remote Angular modules/components at runtime without a monorepo build step.
- **Independent deployability** — each micro-frontend (menu, toolbar, overview) can be built and deployed on its own.
- **Shared singleton dependencies** — Angular core packages and shared libraries are deduplicated across remotes using Native Federation's `shareAll` / `singleton` options.
- **nginx reverse proxy** — a single entry point that routes requests to the correct micro-frontend container.

- [Angular CLI](https://angular.io/cli) (`npm install -g @angular/cli`)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) & Docker Compose

---

## Getting Started

### Local development (recommended for first-time setup)

The fastest way to see the app running is with Node directly — no Docker required.

**1. Install dependencies**

```bash
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

This installs the root workspace and all sub-packages in one go.

**2. Start everything**

```bash
npm run dev
```

This builds the shared `broker` library and then starts all four apps concurrently with colour-coded output:

| Colour | App | URL |
|---|---|---|
| cyan | menu | http://localhost:4201 |
| blue | toolbar | http://localhost:4202 |
| magenta | overview | http://localhost:4203 |
| green | shell | http://localhost:4200 |

Open **http://localhost:4200** in your browser. The shell loads and lazily pulls in each remote as you navigate.

> The `dev` script is equivalent to running `npm run build:libs && npm run start`. Individual apps can also be started in isolation with `npm run start:shell`, `start:menu`, `start:toolbar`, or `start:overview`.

---

### Production-like run (Docker)

To test the full nginx proxy setup as it would run in a real deployment:

### Build

```powershell
.\build.ps1
```

The script:
1. Builds the `broker` shared library from `angular-libs`.
2. Installs dependencies in each app (the `broker` lib is referenced via a local `file:` path in each app's `package.json`).
3. Builds `angular-menu`, `angular-overview`, `angular-toolbar`, and `angular-shell` for production.

### Run

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

Open **http://localhost:8080** — all traffic flows through the nginx proxy, mirroring the Kubernetes ingress setup.

```bash
docker-compose down
```

---

## Ports

**Local dev** (`npm run dev`):

| Service | URL |

## Shared Libraries

`angular-libs` contains the **broker** library — a shared package referenced locally via `file:../angular-libs/dist/broker` in each app's `package.json`. After building `broker`, running `npm install --legacy-peer-deps` in each app resolves the symlink so Native Federation can share it as a singleton across all remotes.

## Kubernetes

### Why K8s and micro-frontends are a natural fit

In the Docker Compose setup, adding or removing a micro-frontend means editing `nginx.conf` and `docker-compose.yml` by hand, then redeploying everything. Kubernetes — combined with Helm — removes that friction entirely.

The key insight is that **each micro-frontend ships its own Helm chart**. It owns its Deployment, Service, and Ingress rule. No other chart needs to change when it is installed or removed. The nginx Ingress controller merges path rules from all installed Ingress resources automatically, so each chart is fully self-contained and independently deployable.

Additional benefits in K8s:

- **Independent scaling** — a heavily used `overview` pod can scale to 10 replicas while `menu` stays at 1.
- **Independent rollouts** — deploy a new version of `toolbar` with a rolling update while everything else keeps running.
- **Health-based traffic** — readiness/liveness probes keep broken pods out of rotation automatically.
- **Zero-downtime ingress changes** — nginx Ingress controllers merge and reload rules without dropping connections.

### Helm chart structure

There is a **base chart** that is always present — it contains the shell, the menu-service, and any other core infrastructure. Everything else is optional and can be installed or removed independently.

```
charts/
├── base/                   # Always installed — shell, menu-service, ingress controller
│   ├── Chart.yaml
│   └── templates/
│       ├── shell-deployment.yaml
│       ├── shell-service.yaml
│       ├── shell-ingress.yaml
│       ├── menu-service-deployment.yaml
│       └── menu-service-service.yaml
│
├── overview/               # Optional — install or remove without touching anything else
│   ├── Chart.yaml
│   └── templates/
│       ├── deployment.yaml
│       ├── service.yaml
│       └── ingress.yaml    # Owns its own /getModule/overview path rule
│
├── toolbar/                # Optional
│   ├── Chart.yaml
│   └── templates/
│       ├── deployment.yaml
│       ├── service.yaml
│       └── ingress.yaml
│
└── reporting/              # Optional — a brand-new team deploys this independently
    ├── Chart.yaml
    └── templates/
        ├── deployment.yaml
        ├── service.yaml
        └── ingress.yaml
```

Each optional chart's Ingress is self-contained. Here is `overview` as an example:

```yaml
# charts/overview/templates/ingress.yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: overview
  annotations:
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /$2
spec:
  rules:
    - http:
        paths:
          - path: /getModule/overview(/|$)(.*)
            pathType: ImplementationSpecific
            backend:
              service:
                name: overview
                port:
                  number: 80
```

Installing and removing a micro-frontend is a single Helm command:

```bash
# Add a new micro-frontend — the cluster starts routing to it immediately
helm install overview ./charts/overview

# Remove it — the Ingress rule disappears with the chart
helm uninstall overview
```

Combined with the menu-service's self-registration (described below), **a single `helm install` is all it takes** to make a new feature live for the right users — and `helm uninstall` cleanly removes it without touching any other chart.

## Dynamic manifest — how it works today

There is no static `federation.manifest.json`. The shell builds its NF manifest at runtime from the menu API, which is the single source of truth for both navigation and remote loading.

### Two categories of remotes

| Category | Examples | Registered via |
|---|---|---|
| **Infrastructure** | `menu`, `toolbar` | `environment.infrastructureRemotes` — deployed with the shell Helm chart |
| **Feature** | `overview`, `reports`, `analytics`, `export` | `/api/menu` — driven by `MenuEntry` CRDs |

### Bootstrap sequence

```ts
// main.ts — runs before Angular bootstraps
async function bootstrap() {
  const items: MenuItem[] = await fetch('/api/menu').then(r => r.json());

  const manifest = {
    ...environment.infrastructureRemotes,           // always present
    ...Object.fromEntries(items.map(i => [i.remote, i.remoteEntry])),
  };

  (window as any)['__MENU_ITEMS__'] = items;        // stash — avoids double fetch
  await initFederation(manifest);
  await import('./bootstrap');                       // Angular starts here
}
```

### MenuItem interface

```ts
interface MenuItem {
  label: string;          // "Dashboard"
  path: string;           // "dashboard"
  icon?: string;          // "pi pi-home"
  group?: string;         // "Overview"
  remote: string;         // "overview"  — NF remote key
  remoteEntry: string;    // "https://gateway/remotes/overview/remoteEntry.json"
  exposedModule: string;  // "./routes"
  routesExport?: string;  // "APP_ROUTES" (default)
}
```

The `remoteEntry` field is set by the menu service operator when it processes a `MenuEntry` CRD — the shell never hard-codes any remote URL.
